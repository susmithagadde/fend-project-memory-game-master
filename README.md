# Memory Game Project

## What is the Memory Game
This is a simple game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different icons. 

## Challenge
Match cards in less time with less moves.

## How I built the Memory Game
I manipulated the DOM with JS, altered part of the HTML and also styled the game

- Created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
- Created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
- Added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
- Create a pop-up modal when player wins game

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
